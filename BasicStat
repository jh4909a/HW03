Commands:
pnorm= gives you the probability
rbinom
pt= density function; gives you the height of the curve
rnorm= generates random variables

Command for a t test:
x = rnorm(any number)
y = rnorm(any number)
t.test(x,y)

Command for a Paired t-test:
two variables measured on the same situation
ex. of two people on the same diet
t.test(x,y,paired=TRUE)

Command for a one sample t-test:
t.test(x,mu=0)
to test to see if the mean is 0

To pull from one that has already been done:
Assign the one you have already done to V
V$p.value

Definitions:
p=probability
d=density
q=quantile
r=random
null hypothesis= the means are equal

Examples:
dnorm(-1)
